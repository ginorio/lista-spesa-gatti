Purpose

This app saves time between ‚Äúwhat to buy where‚Äù and ‚Äúhow many units I need‚Äù ‚Äî especially if you shop at different stores on different schedules. The OCR import removes the annoyance of rewriting a paper list.


---

Screens and Flow

Home ‚Äì Choose list type (monthly / bi-weekly / weekly), manage products, or import a list from a photo.

Products ‚Äì Filtered by list, search and adjust quantities with +/‚àí buttons.

Summary ‚Äì Groups by list, includes cross-list products, allows item check-off, share via WhatsApp, and download PDF.

Manage ‚Äì Add new products, bulk move selected items to another list, edit names or assigned lists, or delete.


Data is now stored in Lovable Cloud (Supabase) with user authentication and automatic sync.

Data Model

Available list types: monthly | biweekly | weekly | shared.
Each Product may belong to multiple lists (types: ShoppingType[]) and holds quantity and checked state.
